# Cryptography

## Introduction

Cryptographic Features with Java (Using Java Crypto Library and Mathematical Java Coding (RSA and Stream Ciphers) to solve Cryptography Problems) </br>
If you want to learn more about Cryptography Please refer to the [Introduction to Computer Security](https://github.com/healthgongdoll/Computer-Security-Study).

## Cryptography Studies 

1. Classical Cryptography (Caesar, Vigenere)
2. Symmetric Cryptography (DES, AES)
3. Asymmetric Cryptography (RSA, Diffe Hellman)
4. HASH (MD5, SHA512, HMAC, MAC)
5. Quantum Cryptography (BB84 Protocol)
